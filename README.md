# fansite

a fan site (free topic)
I choose Photography because this is an other passion of mine.
All photos are mine and therefore subject to copyright. 
Unfortunately I no longer have the originals, the resolution isn't great, but that's not the primary goal of the exercise.
Feel free to comment, both, dev and photography !
